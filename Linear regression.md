After learning about the important libraries, now you are ready to start your journey of machine learning. 


## 1. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning 
***


Each type of machine learning model serves different purposes and is chosen based on the nature of the problem and the type of data available. By understanding these basic categories, we can better select and apply the appropriate ML techniques to real-world problems.

You are required to install jupyter notebooks and learn basics of it as we are going to use it throughout the course.

Note : No need to go in depth of jupyter notebook as you need it’s basics only and
will learn more throughout the course. *Don’t forget to try some codes in your notebook!*

## 2. Regression Model
***

In this module you will learn about linear regression. It will seem quite simple but advised to listen carefully and practise the things you are taught. Give time to understand the optional labs mentioned in the videos.

## 3. Training with Gradient Descent 
***


In this module, we are going to provide an overview of gradient descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning to minimize functions and improve model performance.

Now as you are ready to make a linear regression model. Let us try to make some 
models of which you all are familiar. 
	
Problem Statement : Plot a best fit line for the following set of points.  
1. [(1,1)  (2,2)  (3,1)]  Can you tell from which special point the line passes?
2. [(1,1)  (1,2)  (2,2)  (2,1)]
3. [(1,1)  (2,1.5)  (2,0.5)  (3,1)]

## 4. Multiple Linear Regression 
***


In this module, we are going to provide an overview of multiple linear regression, a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.


I would recommend attempting the Problem solved in optional labs in this section before seeing its method.

As now you all are capable of making a regression model so here is an interesting 
problem for you all. But before that think whether feature scaling always improves the 
accuracy (reduces the cost more) and speed of the model? Search about it.
