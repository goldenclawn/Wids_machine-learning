# Wids_machine-learning
Welcome to the first week of our Machine Learning Course! This week, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with essential ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation and visualization. Following this, we’ll delve into the foundational concepts of machine learning, including regression and classifiers. 
1. We'll start with the [ML Libaries / Python Modules](./Python%20Modules) to facilitate efficient data manipulation and visualization.
2. Our first ML concept will be [Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression), a powerful technique for modeling relationships between variables.
3. Next, we'll explore [Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression), a fundamental method for binary classification tasks.
4. Now we'll cover [Classifiers](https://github.com/wncc/Machine-Learning-LS-24/tree/main/Week%201/Classifiers%20(OPTIONAL)), which are algorithms used to classify data into different categories based on patterns in the input features.
